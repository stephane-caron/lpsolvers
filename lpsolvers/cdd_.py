    r"""Solve a linear program using the LP solver from cdd.

    The linear program is defined by:

    .. math::

        \\begin{split}\\begin{array}{ll}
            \\mbox{minimize} &
                c^T x \\\\
            \\mbox{subject to}
                & G x \\leq h \\\\
                & A x = b
        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    It is solved using `cdd <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c :
        Linear cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    solver :
        Solver to use, default is GLPK if available

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Optimal (primal) solution of the linear program, if it exists.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the linear program is not feasible.
