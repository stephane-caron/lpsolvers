    The linear program is defined by:

    .. math::

        \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
            \mbox{minimize} &
                c^T x \\

    It is solved using the LP solver from `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c :
        Linear cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    solver :

    Returns
    -------

    ------
