"""Solver interface for `ProxQP`_.

.. _ProxQP: https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite#proxqp

ProxQP is the QP solver from ProxSuite, a collection of open-source solvers
rooted in revisited primal-dual proximal algorithms. If you use ProxQP in some
academic work, consider citing the corresponding paper [Bambade2022]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem :
        Quadratic program to solve.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.

        ProxQP backend to use in ``[None, "dense", "sparse"]``. If ``None``

        Solution to the QP returned by the solver.

    ------
    ParamError
        If a warm-start value is given both in `initvals` and the `x` keyword
        argument.

    Notes
    -----
    All other keyword arguments are forwarded as options to ProxQP. For
    instance, you can call ``proxqp_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, eps_abs=1e-6)``.
    For a quick overview, the solver accepts the following settings:

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 30 70
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Name
         - Effect
       * - ``x``
         - Warm start value for the primal variable.
       * - ``y``
         - Warm start value for the dual Lagrange multiplier for equality
           constraints.
       * - ``z``
         - Warm start value for the dual Lagrange multiplier for inequality
           constraints.
       * - ``eps_abs``
         - Asbolute stopping criterion of the solver (default: 1e-3, note that
           this is a laxer default than other solvers). See *e.g.*
           [tolerances]_ for an overview of solver tolerances.
       * - ``eps_rel``
         - Relative stopping criterion of the solver. See *e.g.* [tolerances]_
           for an overview of solver tolerances.
       * - ``mu_eq``
         - Proximal step size wrt equality constraints multiplier.
       * - ``mu_in``
         - Proximal step size wrt inequality constraints multiplier.
       * - ``rho``
         - Proximal step size wrt primal variable.
       * - ``compute_preconditioner``
         - If ``True`` (default), the preconditioner will be derived.
       * - ``compute_timings``
         - If ``True`` (default), timings will be computed by the solver (setup
           time, solving time, and run time = setup time + solving time).
       * - ``max_iter``
         - Maximal number of authorized outer iterations.
       * - ``initial_guess``
         - Sets the initial guess option for initilizing x, y and z.

    This list is not exhaustive. Check out the `solver documentation
    <https://simple-robotics.github.io/proxsuite/>`__ for details.
