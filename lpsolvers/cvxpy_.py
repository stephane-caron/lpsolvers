    r"""Solve a linear program using CVXPY.

    The linear program is defined by:

    .. math::

        \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
        \mbox{minimize}
            & c^T x \\
        \mbox{subject to}
            & G x \leq h \\
            & A x = b
        \end{array}\end{split}

    It is solved using a solver wrapped by `CVXPY <http://www.cvxpy.org/>`_.
    The underlying solver is selected via the corresponding keyword argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c :
        Linear cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    solver :
        Solver name in ``cvxpy.installed_solvers()``.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    x : array, shape=(n,)
        Optimal (primal) solution of the linear program, if it exists.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the LP is not feasible.
